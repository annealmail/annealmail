  <h3>Using AnnealMail when reading messages</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt>Decrypt button in main Mail window</dt>

    <dd>This button can be used for several purposes: decrypt, verify, or import public keys. Normally decryption/verification happens automatically, although this can be disabled through a preference. However, if this fails, usually a short error message will appear in the AnnealMail status line. If you click the Decrypt button, you will be able to see a more detailed error message, including the output from the GnuPG command.</dd>

    <dt>Pen and Key icons in Message Header display</dt>

    <dd>
      The <em>Pen</em> and <em>Key</em> icons in the Message Header display indicate if the message you are reading was signed and/or encrypted and if the signature is good, i.e. the message has not been changed since it was signed. If the message has been changed, the <em>Pen</em> icon will change to a <em>Broken Pen</em> to indicate that the signature is bad. Right clicking on either the Pen or Key icons will bring up a menu with the following options:

      <ul>
        <li><em>AnnealMail Security info</em>: allows you to view the output status from GnuPG for the message.</li>

        <li><em>Copy AnnealMail Security info</em>: copies the output status from GnuPG to the clipboard; to paste into a reply message, etc.</li>

        <li><em>View OpenPGP Photo ID</em>: allows you to view the <em>Photo ID</em> of the person who sent the message, if they have a photo embedded in their Public Key. (<em>This option will only be enabled if a Photo ID exists in their key.)</em></li>

        <li><em>S/MIME Security info</em>: allows you to view the S/MIME Security Info for the message.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you do not have <em>keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve</em> set in your <tt>ccr.conf</tt> file and you read a message which is signed or encrypted, you will see a <em>Pen</em> icon in the headers display area with a <em>Question mark</em> on it, the AnnealMail status line in the headers area will say <em>Part of the message signed; click pen icon for details</em> and the message in the Message Pane will show all the OpenPGP message block indicators and the signature block.</p>

      <p>You may also see this if you have <em>keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve</em> set in your <tt>ccr.conf</tt> file and the OpenPGP key is not available on the default keyserver.</p>

      <p>Clicking on the <em>Pen and Question mark</em> icon will bring up a window advising that the key is unavailable in your keyring. Clicking on OK will bring up another window with a list of keyservers from which you can select to download the sender's public key from.</p>

      <p>To configure the list of keyservers you wish to use, go to <strong>AnnealMail -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Basic</strong> tab and enter the keyserver addresses in the <em>Keyserver(s):</em> box, separated by a comma. <em>The first keyserver in the list will be used as the default.</em></p>
